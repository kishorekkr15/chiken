Hi Team,

I hope you are doing well.
I have shared the Knowledge Transfer (KT) of Bibvault with Mr. Kishore Kumar and Mr. Vidhyasagar. Kindly find  the attached Dev/Demo PEM key file for further actions.
Here are the SSH details:
Dev SSH String: ssh -i "bibvault_dev.pem" ec2-user@ec2-35-179-88-223.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Demo SSH String: ssh -i "bibvault_dev.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-135-20-11.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Please find the attachment for the key file and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
